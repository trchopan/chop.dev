#+TITLE: How This Website Was Built

I'm from Vietnam so Luna New Year is a big holiday. I and my family, we had a lot of fun gathering together. This is the first year Lina is growed up enough for me and my wife to take her travel (last year she was only 1 month old so we have to stay home). We spent the holiday with my parents in an AirBnB at the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, Landmark 81.

A long holiday also means I have some time to do things that I like "learning new things". And man, do I enjoy what I found, ~emacs~, ~org mode~, ~hugo~, ~literate configuration~. I was having a great time.

The personal website I had was a bit old. 2 years now I think. So It's the right time to improve it. I determined and set out about 2 hours a day when ever I can to build it during the holiday. And here is my note on it:

*  Hugo

** Static site generator

#+begin_quote
Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
#+end_quote

Yes. All of the quote from their website is true. It was speedy, it was fun âš¡

I went through the [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/][Quick Start]] with ease and got the site runing.

Then I replace the Anake theme with [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/][Terminal]] by [[https://twitter.com/panr][panr]].

And voilÃ , A cool looking website with a look and feel of my usual working environment as a software engineer.


** Go module or Git clone

I was toying arround with =Go Module= at the start for the theme. But try my hand on editting the theme, =Git clone= is better solution. It let me manage and current theme implementation and keep track of my changes.

Note to self, should move the changed from inside the =/themes/termial= folder to the =root folder= to apply custom changes.


** My understanding

My experience with Hugo was brief (1 week), but I feel the design was really well thought.

Hugo is the build tool that is very well documented, has incredible performance and has great community support. This act as a tool box for all your static website needs, all we have to do is provide the material (the content files) and the decoration (the theme).

* Emacs and Org mode

** Doom emacs

I got hooked on emacs for about a month now.

It was a great tool and environment to explore. I am a Vim user, in other words, I used to configure my own tool and tinker around all the internal parts and customization.
