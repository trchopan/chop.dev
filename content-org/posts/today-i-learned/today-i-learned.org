I started using Emacs about a week ago <2022-01-24 Mon> . With such powerful tool I should begin the habit to write things down. It will improve my workflow and help me into a more organise mode.

** Neovim plugin - vim-abolish

It really nice to switch cases using just simple key stroke.

After install =vim-abolish=, put cursor at ~snake_case~ and press ~crt~ to turn it into ~snakeCase~

How awesome is that.

Apart from the this Coercion feature (I still don't understand why they name case switching that). vim-abolish also can help with replacement. Try things like this

#+begin_src bash
:Subvert/blog{,s}/post{,s}/g
#+end_src

** Xcode macOS upgrade

After upgrade to the new version, most my binary got broken, unable to start due to linking.

Includes: git, neovim, etc.

Pretty much anything install by brew.

The solution is I need to reinstall xcode and agree to the new Agreement for the new OS version.

Using following commands:

#+begin_src bash
xcode-select --install

sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
#+end_src

** Ungreedy Regex match

Today I learned about regex Ungreedy match while dealing with a buggy parser.

I had a org link parser for links

#+begin_src
INPUT:
This is a link [[https://example.com] [Example]] and [[https://another.com] [Another]]

EXPECT OUTPUT:
This is a link <a>Example</a> and <a>Another</a>
#+end_src

*** With greedy match

#+begin_src regex
\[\[(.*)\] \[(.*)\]\]
#+end_src

I keep getting

#+begin_src
This is a link Another
#+end_src

Tryout: https://regex101.com/r/7sQcoR/1


*** Turn out I need to implement the ungreedy match to get the expected output.

#+begin_src regex
\[\[(.*?)\] \[(.*?)\]\]
#+end_src

Tryout: https://regex101.com/r/fvx6fF/1

** Haskell groupByKey

Haskell groupBy is not what I expected for ~groupBy~ that I normally use in =lodash=.

It is actually scan the list and group when the predicate evaluate to ~True~.

So I google stackoverflow a bit to come up with the =lodash= version:

#+begin_src haskell
import qualified Data.Map as Map

groupByKey :: Ord k => (v -> k) -> [v] -> Map.Map k [v]
groupByKey key as = Map.fromListWith (++) as'
  where as' = map ((,) <$> key <*> (: [])) as

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ groupByKey fst [(1, "hi"), (2, "ho"), (1, "hey"), (1, "yo")]


-- OUTPUT: fromList [(1,[(1,"yo"),(1,"hey"),(1,"hi")]),(2,[(2,"lo")])]
#+end_src

** Build Emacs on MacOS with M1

Good news, now emacs 28.1 with ~native-comp~ can be run on Macbook with M1 chips. It needs to be built from source, I was able to build it using this repo https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus. One bug took me an hour is the ~gcc~ and ~libgccjit~ test fail during build.

If you see this smoke test fail

#+begin_src
configure: error: Installed libgccjit has failed passing the smoke test.
You can verify it yourself compiling:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html>.
Please report the issue to your distribution.
Here instructions on how to compile and install libgccjit from source:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/JIT>.
#+end_src

It is because the MacOS was updated to new major version. While ~gcc~ and ~libgccjit~ was install by =homebrew= in previous MacOS version. An easy fix is to reinstall both of theem.

#+begin_src bash
brew reinstall gcc libgccjit
#+end_src

** Bug in rust-mode

In Doom Emacs, the config for rust has the option for =+lsp= for using =rust-analyzer=. Without, it will use racer which currently has some bugs of finding the correct tool and path for rust toolchain.

** Problem with Bluetooth

Today my MacOS got bugged out of the Bluetooth. I cannot connect to any device. A quick search solve ti problem by reseting the settings. 2 files needs to be delete:

#+begin_src
/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist

~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.Bluetooth.(uuid).plist
#+end_src

Restart MacOS and let it regenerate the Bluetooth settings.

Then I need to re-pair all my devices but not many.

** It's All about Monads

I found a great article that I keeps reference to while studying Haskell. Everytime I read it Monad becomes more and more easier to understand.

https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads

#+begin_quote
"Monad" enters English from ancient Greek philosophy, where it could mean "almost everything". But then it comes in again later from the philosopher Leibniz, for whom it meant "almost nothing" -- an irreducible particle of perceptual reality. Can't philosophy make up its mind? (No. Has it ever?) Neither philosophical sense will help you understand the role of monads in Haskell. Nor are mathematicians riding to your rescue. Consider the introduction to the definition of "monad" in category theory. It could pound the last nail in the coffin of your ambitions to understand what "monad" means in Haskell. A monad is "an endofunctor (a functor mapping a category to itself), together with two natural transformations required to fulfill certain coherence conditions." (Wikipedia) Admit it: unless you're fresh from studying abstract algebra, you just died a little inside.

** Haskell refactor

Today I refactor a bunch of http request code for the [[https://github.com/trchopan/scheduled-blocks][scheduled-blocks]] project. Haskell continue to amaze me with such easy to read and clean looking code.

#+begin_src haskell
handleEitherFailOrResult :: Either String p -> p
handleEitherFailOrResult e = do
  case e of
    Left  err -> error $ printf "Failed to handle result. Error: %s\n" err
    Right v   -> v

requestAndDecode :: (MonadIO m, FromJSON a) => Request -> m a

** Haskell import must be first

** Haskell Cabal external-libraries

I have been scratching my head all days for the cabal tool to work with the =external-libraries= flag as I need to connect =libsodium= to my current project (=scheduled-blocks=).

Gone through a dozen of Stackoverflow questions but not thing works. I tried ~LD_LIBRARY_PATH~, ~LDFLAGS~, etc. Turn out for =MacOs= on M1 and ~homebrew~, it is

#+begin_src bash

** Haskell beauty of Functional

I've been working on the [[https://github.com/trchopan/scheduled-blocks][scheduled-block]] on and off for a week now. I even take sometime off work (don't tell my boss) to tinker on it. The last couple of days, I've been struggle with the conversion of the seed function for verifing Cardano Slot Leader. Where we need 2 set of seed bytes, one from the Neutral Nonce and one from the Epoch Nonce, then combine them to make the seed.

The Python looks like this

#+begin_src python
def mkSeed(slot, eta0):
    h = hashlib.blake2b(digest_size=32)
    h.update(bytearray([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]))  # neutral nonce
    seedLbytes = h.digest()

    h = hashlib.blake2b(digest_size=32)
    h.update(slot.to_bytes(8, byteorder="big") + binascii.unhexlify(eta0))
    slotToSeedBytes = h.digest()

    seed = [x ^ slotToSeedBytes[i] for i, x in enumerate(seedLbytes)]
    return bytes(seed)
#+end_src

I've been working hard on learning Haskell and the solution at the end was so elegant I was in awe when I have it.

#+begin_src haskell
hashBlake2b :: BS.ByteString -> Digest Blake2b_256
hashBlake2b = hash

seedLBytes :: Digest Blake2b_256
seedLBytes = hashBlake2b neutral
  where neutral = BA.pack [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] :: ByteString

slotToSeedBytes :: Int64 -> ByteString -> Digest Blake2b_256
slotToSeedBytes slot nonce = hashBlake2b $ BS.append encodedSlot nonce
  where encodedSlot = LBS.toStrict $ Binary.encode slot

-- For every seedLBytes xor it with the slotSeedBytes
mkSeed :: Digest Blake2b_256 -> Digest Blake2b_256 -> [Word8]
mkSeed seedLBytes slotToSeedBytes = zipWith xor arrSeedLBytes arrSlotToSeedBytes
 where
  arrSeedLBytes      = B.unpack seedLBytes
  arrSlotToSeedBytes = B.unpack slotToSeedBytes

** Mark jumping in emacs

In =vim=, I was used to the marking jumping with ~`~ (backtick) key. It awesome to jumping around marks in a buffer it help a lot during my workflow. But in Emacs - evil mode, it use ~'~ (single tick) key.

** Emacs terminals

I tried the emacs terminals into my workflow but both the =eshell= and =vterm= did not work out for me.

They feel very strange when using in combination with the evil mode. At first I was curious of editing the command by using normal vim keys, but there was a lot of bug while navigating between lines.

=> Switch back to the terminal app instead of Emacs.


** Npm install from personal repo

I'm using a public repo that ease the use of =cardano-cli= with Javascript but it has some bugs as the maintainer not update so often.

I need to forked it and provide my own fix and learn to use my own version instead of the npm package.

This stackoverflow answer was the my solution: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40528053/npm-install-and-build-of-forked-github-repo][LINK]]

** Inquirer

Today I begin work on the Cardano Commands project. A tool to help me and the pool owner setup the pool securely by separate the authority into 2 part:

- Pool Operator: manage the setup and health of the pool. Example: cardano-cli, cardano-node version, Monitor Graphana, Calculate Block schedule, etc.
- Pool Owner: only one has access to the wallet key with the pledged ADA.

During the development, I found out [[https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js][Inquirer]] . Very nice tool to make interactive console UX/UI.

** Back to PrismJS

I figure out how to configurate PrismJS for the Hugo theme. It actually a static files that I can replace with the PrismJS downloadable configuration.

Just need to go to this pre-selected >> [[https://prismjs.com/download.html#themes=prism-tomorrow&languages=markup+css+clike+javascript+bash+dart+firestore-security-rules+go+go-module+graphql+handlebars+haskell+http+ignore+json+json5+jsonp+lisp+lua+markdown+markup-templating+python+jsx+tsx+regex+rust+sass+scss+shell-session+solidity+toml+typescript+typoscript+vim+yaml&plugins=show-language+toolbar+copy-to-clipboard][Example]] <<

Download the minified version and place it in the script tag to load PrismJS. Then let the theme handle the syntax highlight. Now my code block color is synced up with the theme color. Nice!


** Haskell Concurrency

I begin to study about Haskell Concurrency. It feels a lot like Go, but much safer. Loving the experience.

** Improvement of my English

I'm in the of the process of writing about the making my new website. It make me realize my English is... bad.

There is a tool call [[https://hemingwayapp.com/][Hemingway App]] (named after Ernest Hemingway). Which will grade your writing 'Readability'. I'd use it from now to improve my writing.

** Disqus vs Utterances

I got the comment section to work on [[https://chop.dev][chop.dev]]. I setup [[https://disqus.com][Disqus]] but find out there much better option: [[https://utteranc.es/][Utterances]]. It based on Github issues and much suited for my site because it more developer oriented.

I may use Disqus for my customers who would like some fine control over their site comments.

** Remove PrismJS - no support for emacs-lisp

Checking back on the website, I realized there was no syntax highlight for the code block. Then I spent the morning to find out PrismJS is the culprit. It does not have the syntax for ~emacs-lisp~ scripts. So I disabled it, Turn out Hugo already handled the syntax highlight 👍. It not perfect match with the current theme but it is OK to use.

** A mini bug in Miniview trader

I discovered a bug in the Miniview trader script. The MA calculation method will give wrong value when the length of result match the length of MA. Fix it by replacing the script with much simpler version. Lesson learned again and again: simplify everything.

#+begin_src typescript
import {sum, last} from 'lodash';

const getTechnicals = (data: {close: number}[]) => {
  // Take off the last candle
  const candles = data.slice(0, -1);

  const calculateMa = (len: number) => {
    const _candles =
      len > candles.length ? candles : candles.slice(candles.length - len);
    const _maCloses = _candles.map(x => x.close);
    return sum(_maCloses) / _maCloses.length;
  };

  return {
    last: last(candles)!,
    ma20: calculateMa(20),
    ma55: calculateMa(55),
    ma100: calculateMa(100),
    ma200: calculateMa(200),
    candles,
  };
};

** Block schedule should be calculate with the new epoch snapshot

After chatting with Felix about his pool missing a block he had calculated. We realized that he used the old epoch sigma and stake to calculate the scheduled. Which make me nervous about the Cardano block scheduled for ARMADA pool at 18:20 next day. Luckily, after double checked using the ~ScheduledBlocks~ tool, I confirmed that it was correct and we did received the block.

** What I working on

Mostly I config emacs doom follow my neovim today.

Nvim - treesitter cannot be install on my Raspberry Pi due to arch64 is not supported. Weird that they can be install with npm on my Macbook Air M1. I need to investigate more on this matter.

I'm setting up the Cardano testnet on my Raspberry Pi to debug the setup script that I wrote very long time ago. It now does not work with Alonzo Tx format. I suspect that TK using the address to receive many meme coins, that mess up the Tx calculation.

Update <2022-01-31 Mon>

I knew why, need to check it out though. Must be because the version of ~cardano-cli~ / ~cardano-node~ I'm using on the secret node was old, I have not updated it for 5 months now.


** Emacs

~Zen-mode~ is good. Give me focus on writing. Also the serif font face helps a bit.

Remember to =zz= to center the screen when writing. Otherwise the word suggestion will go crazy.

** Setting up Vue - conflict and old package

Setting up Vue was a pain because the old package [[https://github.com/AdamNiederer/vue-mode][vue-mode]] <= DO NOT USE this.

Vue has a new language server named [[https://github.com/jadestrong/lsp-volar][Volar]] <= Use this instead.
