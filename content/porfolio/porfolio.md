LN‚Ç≥TR - Cardano Stake Pool from Vietnam

## Year

2019

I use a Firebase Cloud Function to periodically pull the information of Stake Pools on Cardano blockchain.

Then I use a ip locator service to locate the country of each pool and store it to Firestore DB. The list of all the pool then cached on GCP Cloud Storage.

The live block production is taken from pool

## Client

ARMDA Stake Pool - armadacardano.io

## Year

2021

As a Cardano Pool operator, I have setup stake pools both on testnets and mainnet since early 2021.

During my setups, the part where I need to manage the keys was the most confusing and error prone. So I wrote this tool to help me automate the steps in handling the pool keys.

Use the Epoch Nonce seeds and compare with the Pool sigma derived VRF key of the Pool to calculate the block assignment schedule.

Reduce the dependancy on running a complete Cardano node as data is taken from blockfrost.io and armada-alliance.com.

This is a rewritten in Haskell of the ScheduledBlocks in Python.
