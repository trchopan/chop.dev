I love to travel with my wife. Every year we visit new places in Vietnam. We have never traveled outside Vietnam, but love to do it one day when Lina is a bit older and Covid-19 a bit under control.

I love watching movies and contemplate the philosophy aspect of the art.

I have a Raspberry Pi and use Plesk as media server.

I run a Cardano relay on AWS.

I play Chess at 900 point level. Play Starcraft at Gold league.
