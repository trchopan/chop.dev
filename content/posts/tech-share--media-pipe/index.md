## Introduction (2 minutes)

**Welcome and Speaker Introduction**

---

"Hello everyone, and welcome to today's tech sharing session. My name is Quang, and I'm a front-end developer at LINE Corporation. I've been working with web applications for over five years now, and recently, I've been exploring some exciting new technologies. One of these is MediaPipe, a cross-platform framework for building multimodal machine learning pipelines.

I had the chance to dive into MediaPipe during a recent hackathon in Japan, and it was an incredible experience. Today, I'm excited to share some of what I've learned with you."

**Session Overview**

## Setting Up MediaPipe for Web (5 minutes)

#### Installation Steps

**Speaker:**

Alright, let's dive into setting up MediaPipe for your web applications. First, we'll cover the installation steps.

1. **Installing MediaPipe via npm:**
   To get started, you'll need to install the MediaPipe package via npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install @mediapipe/tasks-vision
    ```

    This will download the necessary libraries to your project.

2. **Importing MediaPipe modules in your project:**
   If you prefer using a CDN, you can include MediaPipe directly in your HTML file. Add this script tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
    ```html
    <head>
        <script
            src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/vision_bundle.js"
            crossorigin="anonymous"
        ></script>
    </head>
    ```
    This approach is useful if you want to quickly prototype without setting up a full build environment.

#### Basic Project Setup

**Speaker:**

Next, let's set up a basic project structure.

1. **Creating a simple HTML page:**
   Create an `index.html` file in your project directory. This will be the main page where we'll implement our MediaPipe functionality.

2. **Linking MediaPipe and other necessary libraries:**
   Ensure your HTML file includes the MediaPipe script tag we discussed earlier. Additionally, you might want to include a simple structure for displaying video input and results. Hereâ€™s a basic example:
    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
            <title>MediaPipe Gesture Recognition</title>
            <script
                src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/vision_bundle.js"
                crossorigin="anonymous"
            ></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hand Gesture Recognition Demo</h1>
            <video id="webcam" autoplay></video>
            <canvas id="outputCanvas"></canvas>
            <script src="app.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Example Use Case: Hand Gesture Recognition (5 minutes)

#### Overview of the Example

**Speaker:**

Now, let's look at a practical example. Our goal is to implement real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe. Imagine a scenario where you can use hand gestures to enter a password and open a secret web page.

#### Code Walkthrough

**Speaker:**

Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. **Initializing the MediaPipe Gesture Recognition module:**
   In your `app.js` file, start by initializing the Gesture Recognizer:

    ```javascript
    const vision = await FilesetResolver.forVisionTasks(
        'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision@latest/wasm'
    );
    const gestureRecognizer = await GestureRecognizer.createFromOptions(vision, {
        baseOptions: {
            modelAssetPath:
                'https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-tasks/gesture_recognizer/gesture_recognizer.task',
        },
        numHands: 2,
    });
    ```

2. **Capturing video input from the webcam:**
   Set up the webcam feed:

    ```javascript
    const videoElement = document.getElementById('webcam');
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true}).then(stream => {
        videoElement.srcObject = stream;
    });
    ```

3. **Processing the video stream with MediaPipe:**
   Process each frame from the webcam to detect gestures:

    ```javascript
    videoElement.addEventListener('loadeddata', async () => {
        while (true) {
            await gestureRecognizer.recognize(videoElement);
            requestAnimationFrame(renderResults);
        }
    });
    ```

4. **Displaying the results on the web page:**
   Render the results on a canvas overlay:

    ```javascript
    function renderResults(results) {
        const canvas = document.getElementById('outputCanvas');
        const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
        context.drawImage(videoElement, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        // Draw landmarks and gestures
        // ...
    }
    ```

5. **Handle the gesture recognition sequence:**
   Implement logic to handle recognized gestures and match them to a predefined password sequence:

    ```javascript
    const passwordSequence = ['gesture1', 'gesture2', 'gesture3'];
    let currentSequence = [];

    function handleGesture(gesture) {
        currentSequence.push(gesture);
        if (currentSequence.length === passwordSequence.length) {
            if (currentSequence.join('') === passwordSequence.join('')) {
                alert('Password correct! Redirecting...');
                window.location.href = 'secret.html';
            } else {
                alert('Password incorrect. Try again.');
            }
            currentSequence = [];
        }
    }
    ```

#### Live Demo
