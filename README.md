# Hi, I'm Quang Tran aka. Chop

I am a software engineer who is passionate about creating software solutions, developing technology to empower people, and fostering community. Some of the technologies I enjoy working with include Svelte, React, Vue, Deno, Golang, Rust, Haskell, and Elixir.

In 2024, I'm focusing on AI applications. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and user experience, exploring how intelligent systems can be seamlessly integrated into everyday applications to provide more intuitive experiences.
